### Scope Inference and Scope-Safe Programming

This repository contains two projects:

- The [reference implementation](scope-inference/README.html) for
  "Inferring Scope through Syntactic Sugar", ICFP'17.
- An [experimental attempt](scope-safe-programming/README) at using
  the ideas from the paper to provide a representation of terms in
  Haskell that is *scope safe*, such that unhygienic transformations
  do not type check.
