### Installation & Testing ###

To run, first install rust (version >= 1.9):

    curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh

(Other installation methods are given at https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html)

Then run the tests with:

    cargo test

To see the resugared scopes, run:

    cargo run

The also prints out the wall-clock running time of resugaring, and of parsing+resugaring.

(In both cases, make sure you are in the top level directory (that contains Cargo.toml and src/))



### Overview ###

The language definition files are called

    example_1.scope
    example_2.scope
    pyret.scope

Each language consists of a list of core scoping constructs, which have arities and scoping rules,
followed by a list of desugaring rules of the form "rule Term1 => Term2".

The scoping rules have a friendlier format than what is given in the paper. The meaning is as follows:

    "import i"     means  "i  ⋖  R↑"
    "export i"     means  "R↓ ⋖  i "
    "bind i in j"  means  "j  ⋖  i "
