### Installation & Testing ###

To run, first install rust (version >= 1.9):

    curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh

(Other installation methods are given at
 https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html)

Then run the tests with:

    cargo test

To see wallclock running time, uncomment the lines beneath:

    /* UNCOMMENT TO SHOW ELAPSED TIME */

Likewise, to see a language's resugared scope, uncomment:

    /* UNCOMMENT TO SHOW RESUGARED SCOPE */

(These purposefully panic to cause the test to fail; otherwise the
 test's output would be suppressed.)


### File overview ###

The language definition files are called

    example_1.scope
    example_2.scope
    pyret.scope

The test cases are given in `tests.rs`.
